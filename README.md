# Silhouette website

https://silhouette.exchange/

Currently is just a rush-job to get something out there. The site is a simple static site hosted by GH pages.

Plan:
1. Finish designs & copy
2. Create full website (possibly still static)
3. Host on IPFS (see [Bonafida](https://blog.marlin.org/bonfida-case-study-decentralized-gateways-for-solana-name-service-domains-using-marlin-oyster)) for insporation)
